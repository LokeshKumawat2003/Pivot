# Pokémon  Web Application

## Overview

The Pokémon Explorer Web Application is a frontend project built with React, Next.js,  and Tailwind CSS. The goal is to create an interactive application that allows users to explore various Pokémon through a series of progressive challenges.

## Technology Stack

### Primary Technologies
* *React*: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* *Next.js*: A React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation.
* *TypeScript*: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types, enhancing code quality and maintainability.
* *Tailwind CSS*: A utility-first CSS framework for designing responsive and modern user interfaces.

### Optional/Preferred Backend
* *Node.js + Express*: For building a RESTful API (optional).
* *MongoDB*: A NoSQL database (nice to have, but not mandatory).
* *Pokémon API*: For fetching Pokémon data dynamically or using static constants as a fallback.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate frontend development skills by building a Pokémon Explorer Web Application. The project consists of three progressive challenges that will enhance the application's functionality and design.

## Project Challenges

### Challenge 1: Pokémon Card Component
* *Objective*: Create a reusable Pokémon card component that displays information about various Pokémon, including:

  • Types (e.g., Water, Fire)
  • Basic stats (e.g., HP, Attack, Defense)

### Challenge 2: Pokémon List Page (to be defined)
